-Name, race Dread Knight
\end{quote}

Dread Knights are spellcasters born with the magical spark in them - but in a dark and twisted form.
Some embrace it, becoming merciless killers, antipaladins.
Others try to turn their powers towards good, becoming dark avengers of sorts.
The thing all Dread Knights have in common is that when one shows up, things are about to go horribly wrong for someone.

\subsubsection{Class Features}
All the following are class features of the Dread Knight.

\paragraph{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} 
Dread Knights are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, 
with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light, but not exotic armors),
and with shields (except tower shields and exotic shields).

\paragraph{Spell Points/Day:} A Dread Knight's ability to cast spells is limited by the spell points he has available. 
His base daily allotment of spell points is given on \nameref{tab:DreadKnight} table. 
In addition, he receives bonus spell points per day if he has a high Charisma score.
His race may also provide bonus spell points per day, as may certain feats and items.

\paragraph{Spells Known:} A Dread Knight begins play knowing one Dread Knight spell of your choice. 
Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new spells.
Choose the spells known from the Dread Knight spell list
(Exception: The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a Dread Knight to learn spells of other classes, even specialist Wizard spells.).
A Dread Knight can cast any spell he knows that has a spell point cost equal to or lower than his caster level.
The number of times a Dread Knight can cast spells in a day is limited only by his daily spell points. 
A Dread Knight simply knows his spells; they are ingrained in his mind, though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent spell points.
The Difficulty Class for saving throws against Dread Knight spells is 10 + one-half the number of spell points spent on the spell (round up) + the Dread Knight's Charisma modifier. 

Spells learned via the Dread Knight class are arcane spells.
\paragraph{Maximum Spell Level Known:} A Dread Knight begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level spells. 
As he attains higher levels, a Dread Knight may gain the ability to master more complex spells, as shown on the \nameref{tab:DreadKnight} table.
To learn or cast a spell, a Dread Knight must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level.

\paragraph{Bonus Feats:}
At 1st level, a Dread Knight gets a bonus feat in addition to the feat that any 1st level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character.
The Dread Knight gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th). 
These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats, or those feats which have one or more Dread Knight levels as a prerequisite\footnote{
The feats that require Dread Knight levels to take are \nameref{Feat:BastardsStrike}, \nameref{Feat:CurseOfTheDreadKnight}.}. 
The Dread Knight must still meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat, 
including ability score and base attack bonus minimums as well as class requirements. 
A Dread Knight cannot choose feats that specifically require levels in the fighter class 
unless he is a multiclass character with the requisite levels in the fighter class.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. 
A Dread Knight is not limited to fighter bonus feats and feats with Dread Knight levels as a requirement when choosing these other feats.

\paragraph{Dark Grace: (Su)} 
A Dread Knight gains a bonus on all saving throws equal to his Charisma modifier or his Dread Knight level, whichever is lower.
This is a Supernatural ability that functions continuously.
\subsubsection{Ex-Dread Knights:}
A Dread Knight who changes to a good alignment loses his ability to cast Dread Knight spells, 
the Dark Grace class feature, 
and all supernatural feats that have one or more Dread Knight levels as a prerequisite.
The spellcasting and other abilities remain dormant until he atones (see the \nameref{Spell:Atonement} spell description).

\subsubsection[Bastard's Strike]{Bastard's Strike [Magical]}
Your blows are more lethal than they have any right to be.
\label{Feat:BastardsStrike}

\paragraph{Prerequisite:} Dread Knight level 1st.

\paragraph{Benefit:}
By expending your magical focus, you can automatically confirm a critical threat you have just rolled.

This is a supernatural ability whose activation is part of the attack.
\subsubsection[Curse of the Dread Knight]{Curse of the Dread Knight [Magical]}
\label{Feat:CurseOfTheDreadKnight}
You can lay down a weakening curse upon your enemies.

\paragraph{Prerequisite:} Dread Knight level 1st.

\paragraph{Benefit:}
By expending your magical focus as a swift action, 
you can call upon dark powers to target one or more creatures within 30' with a curse.
Each individual targeted creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + $1/2$ your character level + your Charisma modifier) 
or take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks and skill checks for one hour.

At Dread Knight level 7th, the penalty increases to -4. At 14th level, it increases to -6.

This is a supernatural ability.
\subsubsection{Bleeding Edge}
Makes a weapon cause wounds that bleed over time. Con damage?
\subsubsection{Cerebral Disturbance}
Touch attack, no-save slow.
\subsubsection{Darkbolt}
Single-target damage + stun.
\subsubsection{Rotting Curse}
Con damage per hour.
