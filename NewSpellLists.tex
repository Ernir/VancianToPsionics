\subsection{New Cleric Domains and Spells}
\label{sec:NewClericDomains}
\subsubsection{Commerce Domain}
\label{sec:CommerceDomain}
\paragraph{Granted Powers}
\subparagraph{Class Skill:}
You add Appraise to your list of Cleric class skills.
\subparagraph{Favorable Background:} A 1st-level character with this domain receives double the normal starting gold for his class. This has no effect on gold gain at subsequent levels, nor does it affect characters who gain this domain at levels other than 1st.
\subparagraph{Goldtongue (Su):}
You receive a sacred bonus equal to one-half your Cleric level (minimum 1) on Diplomacy checks made as part of haggling or mediating trades, as well as on Profession checks used to make a living.
This is a superatural ability that is continuously active.
\subparagraph{Marketing (Ex):}
Starting at Cleric level 4th, you become supremely good at finding ways to market your goods. You receive 25\% more than listed market price when selling found goods (usually gems and art objects). This does not apply to magical objects or trade goods (such as salt or silk, see the Wealth Other Than Coins table).

This is a divinely granted extraordinary ability. The powers of Commerce, while ready to support their more active paragons, do not take kindly to significant disruption of economies and will revoke this ability if abused.
\subparagraph{Market Awareness (Su):}
Starting at Cleric level 8th, you are continuously aware of ways you can do business while in a settlement.

When attempting to procure a certain type of item, you immediately sense whether that item is purchasable within the settlement.
If it is purchasable, you know where (you learn the direction and distance). If it is available in more than one location, you know the closest location.

You can not find a specific or unique item. You must be familiar with the type of item in question. You only sense items currently available for public sale, not closed auctions or items the possessor does not intend to sell (even if a sufficiently lucrative offer might persuade him to).
\subparagraph{Two for One (Ex):}
At Cleric level 12th or later, you can find the deal of a lifetime.

To use this ability, make a purchase of a magic item, as normal. Circumstances then conspire to provide you with another, functionally identical magic item upon completion of the purchase, at no cost to you.

The item must be one that can be freely purchased for gold on the open market, not an artifact or other kind of unique item. The item's cost may not exceed 20\% of the value (not market sale value) of your current possessions.

Any given character can only use this ability once in his career.
