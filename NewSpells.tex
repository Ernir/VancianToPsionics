\emph{You bring out the image of a full moon in the minds of your subjects.}

A lycanthrope affected by this spell must succeed on a will save or be forced to assume its animal form at the earliest opportunity - usually on its next action. A lycanthrope already in its animal form is not affected.
Even if the lycanthrope succeeds on the will save, you know that the spell had an effect on the subject - that is, you know with absolute certainty that the creature is in fact a lycanthrope.

Non-lycanthropes suffer no ill effect from this spell.
\paragraph{Augment:}
For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional target.%, and its saving throw DC increases by 1. 
No target of the spell can be more than 30 feet from another target of the spell.

\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{``A WITCH! BURN HER!''}

This spell reveals to you whether the target of the spell has any spellcasting ability. Spell-like and Supernatural abilities do not register.

If the subject resists the spell with a successful Will save or you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the spell reveals no information. Otherwise, the spell reveals an absolute answer (either ``no spellcasting ability'' or ``spellcasting ability'').

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional target within range.

\subsubsection[Swift Fly]{Fly, Swift}

\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 2 rounds

\emph{You rise from the ground in a swirl of rapidly burning arcane energy.}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:Fly} spell (excluding augmentation options), except as noted here.

If the spell expires while the target is still aloft, it only floats for one round, rather than 1d6 rounds.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.
\subsection{'G' Spells}
\subsubsection{Goldskin}
\label{Spell:Goldskin}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 4
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{The shimmering golden glow protects you from being molested by proletarians.}

Each time you are struck with a manufactured weapon, the attacker loses 7 gold pieces from those stored on his person.
The gold pieces are transferred on to your person. Extradimensional storage spaces accessed via magic items (such as Bags of Holding) count as being on a character's person for purposes of this spell.

Should the attacker not have 7 gold pieces to spare, the attack deals no damage.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every additional spell point spent, the attacker loses an additional gold piece per hit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{'H' Spells}
\subsubsection{Hand of Midas}
\label{Spell:HandOfMidas}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 7
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature OR one object; see text
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates OR fortitude negates (object); see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 13, XP; see text

\emph{``I did not say you would be rich. I said you would be worth a lot!''}

A targeted creature is turned into a mindless, inert statue of gold.
It is unaware of its surroundings, as well as the passage of time. It does not age. Its gear is not affected by the transformation.

The creature and each of its items retains its own hit point total throughout the transformation, and its hardness changes to 5.
Destroying the statue kills the creature.

The transmuted creature is considered a Construct for the purposes of targeting it with spells and other abilities.

An augmented \nameref{Spell:RemoveCurse} spell can restore the transmuted creature.

Alternatively, you can affect a nonmagical object, or part of a larger nonmagical object distinctive enough to be considered an object in its own right (such as a doorknob or a wagon wheel).

\emph{Experience Cost:} 10 XP per pound of the creature or object to be transmuted.

Unlike most spells with an experience cost, you must pay this cost when the spell takes effect, not when the spell is cast.
If expending this amount of experience would cause you to go down a level, you spend no experience and the spell fails (but the action and spell points are spent).

When placing this spell within \nameref{Item:Matrices} or \nameref{Item:Wands}, you must pay the spell's experience cost (per charge, in the case of wands) at the time of crafting. In such a case, the spell fails if not imbued with sufficient experience to transmute a creature or object of the target's weight.
\subsubsection[Swift Haste]{Haste, Swift}
\label{Spell:SwiftHaste}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 2

\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{Your magical foresight allows you to strike far more effectively than mundane warriors can.}

For the duration of this spell, you gain an insight bonus on weapon attacks (including ranged attacks, but not your spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities) equal to your Intelligence modifier.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend four additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend eight additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to three times your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend twelve additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to four times your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend sixteen additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to five times your Intelligence modifier.

\subsubsection{Moonlust}
\label{Spell:Moonlust}
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Moon 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} Creature touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 3 rounds
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{The creature sits enthralled, staring into the air, as if looking at something no one else can see.}

The caster may \emph{daze} one living creature by making a successful touch attack. 
If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 3 rounds. 
The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the subject is dazed for an additional round.
\subsection{'R' Spells}
\subsubsection{Roguespace}
\label{Spell:Roguespace}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 immediate action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{You instantaneously slide into a pocket dimension, allowing you to avoid harmful effects.}

When you cast this spell in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.

You can cast this spell quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come within range of a dangerous effect.

\paragraph{Augment:} If you spend 4 additional spell points, you take only half damage even on a failed Reflex save.

\subsection{'S' Spells}

\subsubsection{Sepia Snake Ward}
\label{Spell:SepiaSnakeWard}
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 3, Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Target:} One touched pouch or lock

\emph{''I almost feel sorry for the thieves.``}

This spell functions as \nameref{Spell:SepiaSnakeSigil} (including the augmentation option), except as noted here.

When cast on a pouch, the snake strikes those who would attempt to use Sleight of Hand to sneak into the pouch or steal the pouch as a whole using the Sleight of Hand skill.

When cast on a lock, the snake strikes those who would attempt to force it open with the Open Lock skill.

Simply attempting to access the container normally does not trigger the spell.

The hidden ward cannot be detected by normal observation, and \nameref{Spell:DetectMagic} reveals only that the pouch or lock is magical.

\emph{Note:} Magic traps such as Sepia Snake Wards are hard to detect and disable. 
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the runes and Disable Device to thwart them. 
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for a Sepia Snake Ward.

\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 17

\emph{You bring down half the sky on top of your enemies, with devastating results.}

Immediately upon the completion of the spell, and at the start of your turn each round of the spell's duration thereafter, all creatures within the spell's range except for those you specifically exclude are subjected to a \nameref{Spell:MoonBolt}, cast as if augmented to cast a number of spell points equal to the number of spell points you spent on the Starfall spell. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to the creatures struck by the bolts, the Starfall seeks them out on its own.
\subsection{'W' Spells}
