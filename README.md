A Translation of d20 Vancian Spellcasting to Psionic Mechanics.

The project has a [discussion thread](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?194002-3-5-A-Translation-of-Vancian-Spellcasting-to-Psionic-Mechanics) on GitP.com and a tiny little [description page](http://ernir.net/vanciantopsionics/).

## Thanks

This wouldn't exist save for the efforts of many others. These include:
* Xzoltar @ Competitor Games & GitP, who gave the system its first playtesting and me extraordinary amounts of feedback
* Swooper @ GitP, who has found more wording inconsistencies and \LaTeX bugs than I'd like to admit
* Garryl @ GitP, who gave me the first full readthrough, and as a result about 30 inconsistencies in the text
* Seharvepernfan and eggs @ GitP, who have repeatedly showered me with feedback and praise
* The players in my current (2015) campaign, who have actually bothered with reading some of this crap
* The DMs who have taken the leap of faith and used this system in their games
* and everyone else who has commented on the system and listened to me prattle on about it as it was coming up.
