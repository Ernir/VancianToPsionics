\subsubsection{Class Features}
All the following are Class Features of the metamagician prestige class.

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Metamagicians gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

\textbf{Spellcasting:} When a new metamagician level is gained, 
the character gains spell points per day, an increase in caster level, and spells known
as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 3rd-level spells before he added the prestige class level. 
He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. 
If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 3rd-level spells before he became a metamagician, 
he must decide to which class he adds each level of metamagician for the purpose of determining what spellcasting class gains the benefit of the spellcasting advancement.

\textbf{Focused Specialization (Ex):}
A metamagician gives up some of his versatility in magic to focus on that which remains to him.
Upon first entering the metamagician class, choose a school of magic to give up.
From this point onward, you may never learn spells from that school of magic.
You can not give up your school of specialization, or the abjuration school.

\textbf{Easy Metamagic (Su):}
At 5th level, the metamagician gains a limited ability to apply metamagic without interrupting his concentration.
Once per day, he may apply a metamagic feat to a spell without expending his magical focus.
At 9th level, he can do so twice per day.

\textbf{Metamagic Mastery (Su):}
At 10th level, the metamagician's ability to manipulate magic has come to its peak.
Whenever the metamagician applies a metamagic feat to a spell, he pays one less spell point for the metamagic adjustment than normal.
Metamagic feats with a cost of one or no spell points are not affected by this ability.
