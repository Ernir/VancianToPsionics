\subsubsection{Class Features}
All the following are Class Features of the metamage prestige class.

\paragraph{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Metamages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

\paragraph{Spellcasting:} When a new metamage level is gained, 
the character gains spell points per day, an increase in caster level, and spells known
as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 3rd-level spells before he added the prestige class level. 
He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. 
If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 3rd-level spells before he became a metamage, 
he must decide to which class he adds each level of metamage for the purpose of determining what spellcasting class gains the benefit of the spellcasting advancement.

\paragraph{Focused Specialization (Ex):}
A metamage gives up some of his versatility in magic to focus on that which remains to him.
Upon first entering the metamage class, choose a school of magic to give up.
From this point onward, you may never learn spells from that school of magic.
You can not give up your school of specialization, or the abjuration school.

\paragraph{Easy Metamagic (Su):}
At 5th level, the metamage gains a limited ability to apply metamagic without interrupting his concentration.
Once per day, he may apply a metamagic feat to a spell without expending his magical focus.
At 9th level, he can do so twice per day.

\paragraph{Metamagic Mastery (Su):}
At 10th level, the metamage's ability to manipulate magic has come to its peak.
Whenever the metamage applies a metamagic feat to a spell, he pays two less spell points for the metamagic adjustment than normal.
Metamagic feats with a cost of one or no spell points are not affected by this ability.
