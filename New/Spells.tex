\subsubsection{Adapt Body}
\label{Spell:AdaptBody}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 5
\\ \textbf{Display:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level (D)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments.} 

You gain the ability to adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that environment. 
You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take no damage simply from being in that environment.
You need not specify what environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout the duration.

You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. 
Any environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round deals you only half the usual amount of damage.

\subsubsection{Arcane Flux}
\label{Spell:ArcaneFlux}
Abjuration
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 immediate action

\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{``You cause a momentary disruption in the normal flows of magic surrounding a creature, causing spellcasters trouble.''}

\subsubsection{Armaments of Faith}
\label{Spell:ArmamentsOfFaith}
Conjuration (Creation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 0ft.
\\ \textbf{Effect:} A suit of armor AND/OR a shield AND/OR a weapon; see text
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{You extend your arms and spread your legs as a suit of golden, slightly translucent armor assembles itself around your body, a shield appears in your left hand, and a warhammer in your right.}

You conjure the arms and armor needed to see you through a fight.
You can create one suit of armor, one shield, and one weapon with a single casting of this spell. 
You do not need to create all the items you are entitled to create.
These items can be of any kind with which you are proficient, are of masterwork quality, and sized and shaped for you. 
All the items appear on your body. 
If you conjure armor, you do not take penalties for donning your armor hastily.
You must have space on your body for all the items you conjure, for example, you could not conjure armor if you are already wearing armor, nor could you simultaneously conjure a shield and a greatsword (unless you have some ability to simultaneously use a shield and a greatsword).
An item removed from your body disappears instantly.
Regardless of appearance, treat the items as being made of steel for all purposes.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or more of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, this spell's duration increases to 24 hours.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, the items created by this spell are treated as being made of cold iron rather than steel, allowing the weapon to bypass the damage reduction of some creatures.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, the items created by this spell are treated as being made of alchemical silver rather than steel, allowing the weapon to bypass the damage reduction of some creatures.
 \item If you spend 8 additional spell points, the items created by this spell are treated as being made of adamantine rather than steel, increasing their resiliance and allowing the weapon to bypass the damage reduction of some creatures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Arrow of Death}
\label{Spell:ArrowOfDeath}
Necromancy [Death]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} One arrow or bolt touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Until end of round; see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Fort negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No, Yes; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{The arrow turns black as the midnight sky as you finish the incantation.}

A creature struck by the projectile must succeed on a fortitude save or be instantly slain.
Spell resistance applies against the death effect, as does immunity or resistance to death or necromancy effects.
The projectile remains so enhanced only until the end of the current turn. 
If the projectile does not hit a creature before the end of the turn, the spell drains away harmlessly.

\subsubsection{Assault of the Sevenfold Heaven}
\label{Spell:AssaultOfTheSevenFoldHeaven}
Evocation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None; See text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{Seven bursts of light flash from your weapon upon impact, searing your target with the righteous power of the upper planes.}

The target of your next successful attack with the weapon 
(if it is made before the end of the spell's duration)
is subjected to each of the following effects, in order:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item 10 points of fire damage (Reflex half)
 \item 20 points of acid damage (Reflex half)
 \item 40 points of electricity damage (Reflex half)
 \item 1d8 points of constitution damage (Fortitude half)
 \item Turned to stone, as if by a \nameref{Spell:TransmuteFleshAndStone} spell, except the duration is only 1 round (Fortitude negates)
 \item \emph{Confused}, as if by a \nameref{Spell:Confusion} spell (Will negates)
 \item Sent to one of the upper planes for 1 round (Will negates). Unless killed or retained by the powers of those planes in the interim, the subject returns at the end of this duration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Astral Trap}
\label{Spell:AstralTrap}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Planes 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D); see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{A rip to the Astral Plane opens next to the creature, pulling it in.}

The subject is (safely) teleported to a random location on the Astral Plane unless it succeeds on a Will save.
It reappears when the duration of this spell expires, in the same orientation and condition as before.

In each round of the spell's duration, it can attempt a Will save as a full-round action. 
Success allows the subject to return. 
The subject can act normally on its next turn after this spell ends.

If the subject is capable of planar travel, he can use those abilities normally. Traveling out of the trap in this way ends the 

If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his return, he appears in the closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, the spell can target an additional creature within range.

\subsubsection{Aura of Retribution}
\label{Spell:AuraOfRetribution}
Abjuration 
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 20 ft.
\\ \textbf{Area:} 20-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

\emph{An aura of your own particular justice surrounds you, doing to others as they would do to you.}

Any creature within range that directly deals damage to you while the spell is in effect is fatigued for 1 round. A successful Will save negates the fatigue, but an attacker must save again should he damage you again.

\paragraph{Augment:} This spell can be augmented in one of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend two additional spell points, the target is exhausted rather than fatigued.
 \item If you spend six additional spell points, the target is stunned rather than fatigued.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{'B' Spells}

\subsubsection{Baleful Resurrection}
\label{Spell:BalefulResurrection}
Necromancy (Healing) [Evil]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Death 4, Necromancer 5
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 hour
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} Death 7, Necromancer 9; XP; see text

\emph{''I don't know. He just came back... wrong, somehow.``}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:RaiseDead} spell, but with a few significant differences, as outlined here.

In addition to losing a level or point of constitution, the creature comes back to life with one of the curses on the \nameref{tab:BalefulResurrection} table, determined randomly. If it already suffers from that curse (or has the corresponding penalties for another reason), roll again. If no curses remain, the spell fails. Finally, the subject's alignment is shifted one step towards Evil. A creature who is already Evil has its aligment shifted one step towards Chaotic. A Chaotic Evil creature does not suffer a change in alignment.

\begin{table*}
\label{tab:BalefulResurrection}
\caption{Baleful Resurrection curses}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{0.065\textwidth}p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
d\%&  Curse name&  Curse description\\
\midrule
1-13&Bloody cough& The creature occasionally coughs up blood, often with a horrid hacking sound. It takes a -3 penalty on Fortitude saves.\\
14-25&Dead eyes& Most of the color drains out of the creature's eyes, making them resemble that of a corpse. It takes a -6 penalty on Spot checks, and gains the Light Blindness trait, as a Drow.\\
26-38&Dead skin& The creature's skin turns pale and cold, and its sense of touch is greatly reduced. It takes a -3 penalty on Reflex saves.\\
39-50&Hallucinations& The creature suffers from intermittent hallucinations, causing it difficulties in differentiating figment from reality. The creature takes a -3 penalty on Will saves.\\
51-62&Headaches& The creature suffers from constant, distracting headaches. It takes a -2 penalty on Initiative checks and all intelligence-based skill checks.\\
63-75&Social outcast& Intelligent creatures subconsciously dislike the subject. The initial attitude of all non-Evil non-player characters towards the subject is shifted one step towards hostile, and it takes a -6 penalty on Gather Information checks.\\
76-87&Undeath's taint& The creature's brush with death has left it vulnerable to sacred energies. It is treated as an undead creature when caught in the area of a \nameref{Feat:TurnUndead} effect, although it only takes half damage (and may save to halve that damage again). In addition, Necromancy (Healing) spells only heal the creature of half their normal number of hit points.\\
88-100&Wrong smell& Nonintelligent creatures dislike the subject. The initial response of all animals when encountering the subject is either try to flee or to attack it. It takes a -6 penalty on Handle Animal and Ride checks.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

A \nameref{Spell:Wish} or \nameref{Spell:Miracle} spell can remove the creature's curse. A normal \nameref{Spell:RemoveCurse} spell is effective only when cast by a caster of 11th level or higher. An \nameref{Spell:Atonement} spell can restore its original alignment (following the usual rules for the Atonement spell). The level/HD loss or Constitution loss can still not be repaired by any means.

A creature successfully raised with this spell becomes alive and stable at -9 hit points rather than with hit points equal to its HD. Any wounds and disease symptoms repaired as part of the resurrection process are only repaired to the absolute minimum functionality required to return the creature to life. Even if the creature's hit point total is fully restored, such wounds still leave scars, unless removed with the \nameref{Spell:Regenerate} spell. Creatures with visible scars from this process gain a +4 bonus in Intimidate checks, but suffer a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks.

\subsubsection{Banishing Weapon}
\label{Spell:BanishingWeapon}
Transmutation [see text]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Blackguard 5, Paladin 5
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Targets:} One melee weapon
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (harmless, object); see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless, object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{Your weapon becomes a tool to banish outsiders.}

When casting this spell, choose an alignment with which to imbue your weapon. The spell gains that alignment as a descriptor, and banishes outsiders of the opposed alignment.

Any outsider of the appropriate alignment with HD equal to or less than 9 must succeed on a Will save or be banished back to its home plane if struck in combat with a weapon affected by this spell. 
Spell resistance does not apply against the banishment effect.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the weapon can affect an outsider with 2 more HD.
\subsubsection{Blade of the Sun}
\label{Spell:BladeOfTheSun}
Evocation [Good, Light]

The weapon also shines bright light out to a 40' radius, and dim light another 40' beyond that. 
Even after the spell ends, the weapon sheds light as a torch for 1 round.

Casting this spell on a weapon that already has the Brilliant Energy enhancement has no additional effects, 
except with respect to the lighting and interaction with \nameref{Spell:DispelMagic} and similar effects.

\subsubsection{Blade Storm}

Evocation [Force]
\\ \textbf{Level:} War 8

\emph{Whirling blades of force explode out from your outstretched arms, eviscerating your enemies.}

A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun.

You can specifically select any number of creatures within the spell area to exclude from the spell's effect.

A creature struck by the projectile takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.
A successful Fortitude save reduces the Constitution damage by half.

If the projectile does not hit a creature before the end of the turn, the spell drains away harmlessly.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 6 additional spell points you spend, this spell deals an additional 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

\subsubsection{Bow of the Solar}

Necromancy [Death, Good]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S

\\ \textbf{Range:} Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
\\ \textbf{Effect:} Ray
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{A great, partially translucent bow appears in your hands, lasting just long enough for you to fire a single arrow.}

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your opponent.
On a hit, the opponent must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be instantly slain.
An evil creature takes a -4 penalty on the save.
If the save is successful, the creature instead takes damage as if struck by a +2 arrow shot from a composite longbow sized for you, including your full strength modifier and all other situational modifiers that may apply.

\subsection{'C' Spells}
\subsubsection{Call of the Moon}
\label{Spell:CallOfTheMoon}
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Moon 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} Up to five living creatures, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{You bring out the image of a full moon in the minds of your subjects.}

A lycanthrope affected by this spell must succeed on a will save or be forced to assume its animal form at the earliest opportunity - usually on its next action. A lycanthrope already in its animal form is not affected.
Even if the lycanthrope succeeds on the will save, you know that the spell had an effect on the subject - that is, you know with absolute certainty that the creature is in fact a lycanthrope.

Non-lycanthropes suffer no ill effect from this spell.
\paragraph{Augment:}
For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional target.%, and its saving throw DC increases by 1. 
No target of the spell can be more than 30 feet from another target of the spell.

\subsubsection{Celestial Flight}
\label{Spell:CelestialFlight}
Transmutation [Good]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 3

\emph{The subject grows great, white, angelic wings.}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:Fly} spell (including its augmentation option), except as noted here, and that the flight is due to physical wings the subject grows (which matters for effects like those cause by tanglefoot bags).

\subsubsection{Corpse Explosion}
\label{Spell:CorpseExplosion}
Necromancy
\\ \textbf{Level:} Death 7
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action OR 1 immediate action; see text
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One fresh corpse OR recently destroyed undead; see text
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Reflex half; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 13

\emph{You extend your arm, and the corpse begins to bulge.}

The corpse explodes in a \hyperref[sec:AreaShapes]{burst} of bone and flesh.
Any creature within 20' of the corpse takes 1d6 points of damage per HD the corpse had at the time of death. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. 

The targeted corpse must be fresh, dead for no more than one hour per caster level. It must be mostly in one piece prior to the casting of this spell. A corpse that never was alive to begin with is not a corpse for the purposes of this spell. 

Alternatively, you can target a recently destroyed undead creature, destroyed for no more than one hour per caster level. When targeting a destroyed undead creature, use the number of HD it had at the time of destruction for purposes of calculating the damage dealt by this spell.

Ordinarily, casting this spell is a standard action. However, if you catch a creature at the moment of its death (or destruction, in the case of an undead creature), you may cast this spell as an immediate action, causing it to explode on the spot.

\subsubsection{Crisis of Breath}
\label{Spell:CrisisOfBreath}
Necromancy [Mind-Affecting]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S

\\ \textbf{Target:} One breathing humanoid
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates, Fortitude partial; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{You force the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and prevent it from drawing breath again.}

The subject's lungs do not automatically function again while the spell's duration lasts.
If the target succeeds on a Will save when crisis of breath is cast, it is unaffected by this spell. 
If it fails its Will save, it can still continue to breathe by taking a standard action in each round to gasp for breath.
An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), 
but each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks blacking out from lack of oxygen. 
It must succeed on a Fortitude save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. 
The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one that goes by without a breath; 
the DC drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take a breath.
If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it is disabled (0 hp). 
In the following round, it drops to -1 hit points and is dying. 
Curing spells can revive a dying subject normally, so long as this spell's duration has expired; 
if the spell is still in effect, a revived creature is still subject to Fortitude saves in each round when it does not consciously breathe.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or more of the following ways.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend 2 additional spell points, this spell can also affect an animal, fey, giant, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, this spell can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.
 \item If you spend 6 additional spell points, this spell can affect up to four creatures all within a 20-ft.-radius burst.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{``A WITCH! BURN HER!''}

This spell reveals to you whether the target of the spell has any spellcasting ability. Spell-like and Supernatural abilities do not register.

If the subject resists the spell with a successful Will save or you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the spell reveals no information. Otherwise, the spell reveals an absolute answer (either ``no spellcasting ability'' or ``spellcasting ability'').

\\ \textbf{Saving throw:} Fortitude half
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{You pull at the strings of magic surrounding a creature, each cutting it like a thread.}

If a creature targeted by this spell has active spell effects on it at the time of casting,
it takes damage equal to twice the combined number of spell points that were spent on the spells, 
excluding those spell points spent to apply metamagic feats to the spells.
For example, a Wizard under the protection of a \nameref{Spell:MageArmor} spell augmented to cost 3 spell points and an unaugmented, quickened \nameref{Spell:Shield} spell
would take 8 points of damage.

A successful fortitude save halves the damage. The spells are not dispelled.
\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, this spell can affect an additional target.

\subsubsection{Eldritch Orb}
\label{Spell:EldritchOrb}
Evocation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 1, Sor/Wiz 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 0 ft.
\\ \textbf{Effect:} Orb in your palm
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{``The warrior drew his sword, and an orb of angry, purple energy appeared in the mage's hand. The time for negotion was over.''}

The evoked orb can be hurled or used to touch enemies in melee. It provides illumination as a candle.

Used as a melee weapon, it deals 1d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack.
As a thrown weapon, it can be hurled up to 120 feet (with no range penalty), and deal the same damage on a successful ranged touch attack. Immediately after throwing the orb, another appears in your hand.

Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. 
If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

An eldritch orb leaves scorch marks on creatures and surfaces it strikes, but doesn't ignite anything but the most flammable materials (such as oil, paper, or dry straw).

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\subsubsection{Elemental Weapons}
\label{Spell:ElementalWeapons}
Evocation [see text]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{Your weapons hiss with the primal forces of nature.}

For the duration of this spell, all of your weapon attacks (including ranged attacks, but not your spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities) deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage. Choose one of the following energy types upon casting: \emph{Cold}, \emph{Electricity}, or \emph{Fire}.
This spell's descriptor is the same as the type of energy you selected. 
The damage dealt by this spell stacks with any other elemental damage your weapon may deal.

\paragraph{Augment:} For two additional spell points you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\emph{Special:} Casting this spell does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.

\subsubsection{Elfcloak}
\label{Spell:Elfcloak}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{Your clothes and equipment subtly takes on the color and texture of nearby objects, including floors and walls.}

You gain a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the Hide check bonus granted by this spell increases by 1.

\subsection{'F' Spells}

\subsubsection{Feedback Orb}
\label{Spell:FeedbackOrb}
Abjuration
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 4, Spellbreaker 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} Sor/Wiz 7, Spellbreaker 5

\emph{The brilliant white orb speeds towards the mage, erupting into sparks upon impact.}

You fire the orb as a ranged touch attack at any creature within range.

On a successful hit, the target takes 1d4 points of damage. If the target has spell points, he loses five of their daily spell points (to a minimum of zero). He then takes an additional 1d4 points of damage for each spell point lost.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the target loses an additional spell point, with a corresponding increase in potential damage.

\subsubsection[Swift Fly]{Fly, Swift}
\label{Spell:SwiftFly}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 2 rounds
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{You rise from the ground in a swirl of rapidly burning arcane energy.}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:Fly} spell (excluding augmentation options), except as noted here.

If the spell expires while the target is still aloft, it only floats for one round, rather than 1d6 rounds.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.

\subsubsection{Forced Visions}
\label{Spell:ForcedVisions}
Divination [Mind-Affecting]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature with an intelligence score of 3 or more
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{Your victim staggers around, unable to tell the images in its head from what is happening around it.}

Unlike most divination spells, this spell is less about retrieving information than it is to force it upon someone.
For the duration of this spell, the subject's mind is haunted by fairly useless (but factually accurate) 
visions of his past, present, and sometimes even future.
Unless he succeeds on a Will save, the subject is \emph{stunned} for the first round of the spell's duration, the images
momentarily overwhelming its conscious mind. Every round thereafter, at the start of his turn, he must succeed on a will save or be \emph{confused} for that round. 
When such a save succeeds, the subject can suppress the images to the point where it no
longer interferes with his actions, effectively ending the spell.

If desired, the GM can use the following table to determine the kind of vision the subject suffers:
\begin{tableonecolumn}
\caption{Random Visions}
\label{tab:RandomVisions}
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{5.4cm}}
\toprule
d\% &Vision\\
\midrule
1-30 & Childhood memories\\
31-60 & Memories regarding the subject's love life\\
61-70 & Memory resulting in the character shouting out an embarrassing fact about himself\\
71-80 & Memories regarding the character's line of work or training\\
81-90 & A vision of the character as an old man (Does not have to imply that he \emph{will} be old, only that it's a possibility.)\\
91-95 & A vision of the character's surroundings, distorted and confusing\\
96-99 & A vision of the character, as seen from the caster's eyes\\
100 & A truly useful vision of the future\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{tableonecolumn}

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, the subject is stunned for one additional round of the
spell's duration, rather than just the first. A successful will save in a subsequent round still ends the spell.

\subsubsection{Form of the Celestial}
\label{Spell:FormCelestial}
Transmutation (Polymorph) [Good]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 6, Planes 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V,S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level (D)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{You assume the form of a celestial creature, sprouting angelic wings and your skin taking on a different hue.}

You undergo the following changes:
\\ You grow physical wings and can fly at a speed of 100', with good maneuverability. 
\\ You gain darkvision out to 60', and low-light vision.
\\ You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.
\\ You gain resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.
\\ You gain immunity to poison.
\\ You gain the ability to understand, speak, and write all languages, as if by a \nameref{Spell:ComprehendLanguages} spell with the first and second augments.
\\ You gain immunity to some spells, as if you were under the protection of a \nameref{Spell:GlobeOfInvulnerability} spell augmented to cost as many spell points as you spent on this spell. You do not emanate a globe, you only gain the protection yourself.

Your form is humanoid, with functioning hands and legs.

\subsubsection{Free Run}
\label{Spell:FreeRun}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 6, Travel 7
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal and touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} You and up to 5 touched willing creatures
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} Ranger 11, Travel 13

\emph{''A distant drumbeat sounds in your ears, and you feel an irresistible urge to run.``}

For the duration of this spell, the overland distance traveled by the subjects is multiplied by 10 for any given time period.
This multiplication applies only if traveling by foot, not when mounted or using another form of assisted transportation (such as a ship).

Further, the subjects' overland movement is not hindered by negative terrain conditions (as long as the terrain is actually passable), traveling as easily over difficult terrain as a well-made highway.
For example, the subjects could travel across a trackless jungle at full (tenfold) speed, rather than $1/4$ speed.

This does not affect the subjects' tactical movement speed.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell can affect an additional target.

\subsection{'G' Spells}
\subsubsection{Goldskin}
\label{Spell:Goldskin}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 4
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{The shimmering golden glow protects you from being molested by proletarians.}

Each time you are struck with a manufactured weapon, the attacker loses 7 gold pieces from those stored on his person.
The gold pieces are transferred on to your person. Extradimensional storage spaces accessed via magic items (such as Bags of Holding) count as being on a character's person for purposes of this spell.

Should the attacker not have 7 gold pieces to spare, the attack deals no damage.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every additional spell point spent, the attacker loses an additional gold piece per hit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{'H' Spells}
\subsubsection{Hail of Arrows}
\label{Spell:HailOfArrows}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{You let magic take control of your drawing arm, and watch the arrows fly.}

While under the influence of this spell, you can take a full-round action to fire a ranged weapon at up to five targets within range.
Each attack uses your primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single attack.
With those exceptions, this full-round action is similar to making a full attack with a ranged weapon.

\subsubsection{Hand of Midas}
\label{Spell:HandOfMidas}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 7
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature OR one object; see text
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates OR fortitude negates (object); see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 13, XP; see text

\emph{``I did not say you would be rich. I said you would be worth a lot!''}

A targeted creature is turned into a mindless, inert statue of gold.
It is unaware of its surroundings, as well as the passage of time. It does not age. Its gear is not affected by the transformation.

The creature and each of its items retains its own hit point total throughout the transformation, and its hardness changes to 5.
Destroying the statue kills the creature.

The transmuted creature is considered a Construct for the purposes of targeting it with spells and other abilities.

An augmented \nameref{Spell:RemoveCurse} spell can restore the transmuted creature.

Alternatively, you can affect a nonmagical object, or part of a larger nonmagical object distinctive enough to be considered an object in its own right (such as a doorknob or a wagon wheel).

\emph{Experience Cost:} 10 XP per pound of the creature or object to be transmuted.

Unlike most spells with an experience cost, you must pay this cost when the spell takes effect, not when the spell is cast.
If expending this amount of experience would cause you to go down a level, you spend no experience and the spell fails (but the action and spell points are spent).

When placing this spell within \nameref{Item:Matrices} or \nameref{Item:Wands}, you must pay the spell's experience cost (per charge, in the case of wands) at the time of crafting. In such a case, the spell fails if not imbued with sufficient experience to transmute a creature or object of the target's weight.
\subsubsection[Swift Haste]{Haste, Swift}
\label{Spell:SwiftHaste}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Targets:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 2 rounds
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:Haste} spell (excluding augmentation options), except as noted here.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.

\subsubsection{Hawk's Flight}
\label{Spell:HawksFlight}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 3

\emph{The subject grows enormous, gray wings, resembling those of a bird of prey.}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:Fly} spell (including its augmentation option), except as noted here, and that the flight is due to physical wings the subject grows (which matters for effects like those caused by tanglefoot bags).

\subsubsection{Hexenstrike}
\label{Spell:Hexenstrike}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{Your enemies' cursed bones turn brittle beneath your blows.}

For the duration of the spell, whenever you make a weapon attack (including natural attacks and ranged attacks, but not spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities) against a Cursed creature, you gain a bonus on your damage roll equal to your Charisma modifier.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.

\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Permanent (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{``You may be able to kill me, but you need me if you want to see the next minute!''}

The creature gains one negative level. One round later, and each round thereafter, it gains an additional negative level.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a \nameref{Spell:LimitedWish}, \nameref{Spell:Miracle}, \nameref{Spell:RemoveCurse}, or \nameref{Spell:Wish} spell.

\subsubsection{Insightful Strikes}
\label{Spell:InsightfulStrikes}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Arcane Archer 1\footnote{Add the spell to the list of spells available to the class through its Advanced Learning class feature.}, Spellbreaker 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{Your magical foresight allows you to strike far more effectively than mundane warriors can.}

For the duration of this spell, you gain an insight bonus on weapon damage rolls (including your attacks with natural weapons and ranged weapons, but not your spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities) equal to your Intelligence modifier.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend four additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend eight additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to three times your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend twelve additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to four times your Intelligence modifier.
 \item If you spend sixteen additional spell points, the insight bonus becomes equal to five times your Intelligence modifier.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Special:} Casting this spell does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.

\subsection{'L' Spells}

\label{Spell:LastLaugh}
Necromancy
\\ \textbf{Level:} Death 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 immediate action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 30 ft.
\\ \textbf{Area:} 30-ft.-radius burst, centered on you
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{With your deity's name on your lips, you expend the last of your energy in an attempt to take your enemies with you.}

This spell deals 1d8 points of negative energy damage to all creatures within its area, but you die as part of the casting process (you dying is not considered a negative energy effect, or a death effect). If you are a nonliving creature, you are instead destroyed. If you can neither die nor be destroyed by the spell (such as due to you being immune to necromancy spells), the spell fails.

The \nameref{Spell:SpeakWithDead} spell cannot be used to interrogate your corpse. You may be raised from the dead normally.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d8).

\subsubsection{Life Tap}
\label{Spell:LifeTap}
Necromancy
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Targets:} Three living creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{As life flows out of your enemies, you redirect it to flow back into you.}

Whenever a creature makes a weapon attack (including natural attacks and ranged attacks, but not spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities) that successfully deals damage to a creature under the effect of this Curse, the attacker is cured of a number of points of damage equal to one-half the amount of damage dealt.

Hit points can only be gained while the Cursed creature remains at 1 hit point or higher. Any damage that would reduce the creature to 0 or fewer hit points confers no benefit.

No damage is healed by attacks that deal nonlethal damage, such as when attacking a Cursed creature with regeneration.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional creature.

\subsection{'M' Spells}
\subsubsection{Mace of the Astral Deva}

\\ \textbf{Target:} Melee weapon touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{You invoke the powers of the mighty Astral Devas to bring down your enemies.}

A creature struck twice in the same round with a weapon imbued with this spell must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds.
This effect is subject to spell resistance.

\subsubsection{Mental Link}
\label{Spell:MentalLink}
Enchantment
\\ \textbf{Level:} Bard 1, Sor/Wiz 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text
\\ \textbf{Targets:} You and one other willing creature within range that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{You feel your allies like a nugget embedded in your skull.}

The spell creates a limited mental link between you and the target creature, joining your senses.
The effect is that anything heard by one of you is heard by the other.

Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

Assuming you can hear the words you say yourself, this spell allows conversation at a distance.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional target. 
 Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the spell at the time of casting.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, you can attempt to create a bond with a creature that is not willing (Will save negates).
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, the link does work from one plane to another.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Merciful Weapon}
\label{Spell:MercifulWeapon}

\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action or 1 swift action; see text

\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D) or 1 round; see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{``No blood shall be shed this day.''}

All damage dealt by the targeted weapon for the duration of the spell is considered nonlethal damage.

At the time of casting, you make a choice. If you cast the spell as a standard action, the duration is 1 minute per level. 
If you cast it as a swift action, the duration is one round.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, this spell can affect an additional weapon within range.

\subsubsection{Moon Bolt}
\label{Spell:MoonBolt}
Evocation [Light]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Moon 2

\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude partial
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{You blast your enemy with a ball of pure, silvery light.}

The creature takes takes 1d8 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Lycanthropes take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d8).

\\ \textbf{Target:} Creature touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 3 rounds
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{The creature sits enthralled, staring into the air, as if looking at something no one else can see.}

The caster may \emph{daze} one living creature by making a successful touch attack. 
If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 3 rounds. 
The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the subject is dazed for an additional round.

\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude partial; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{Your hand glows with every color of the rainbow before the light coalesces into a ball of the purest light}

An orb of energy about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 7d6 points of damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target.
Any creature struck by the orb must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for one round.

The orb radiates bright light out to 30', and provides shadowy illumination for another 30'. While the orb is too short-lived to serve as an effective light source, it is sufficient to illuminate your surroundings while you select your target.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\subsubsection{Paralyzing Arrow}
\label{Spell:ParalyzingArrow}

\\ \textbf{Duration:} Until end of round; see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Fort negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No, Yes; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{You infuse the arrow with the power to turn your opponents' muscles to water.}

A creature struck by the projectile must succeed on a fortitude save or be \emph{paralyzed} for one round.
Spell resistance applies against the paralysis effect.
The projectile remains so enhanced only until the end of the current turn. 
If the projectile does not hit a creature before the end of the turn, the spell drains away harmlessly.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, the paralysis lasts for an additional round.

\subsubsection{Phase Arrow}
\label{Spell:PhaseArrow}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 5
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round; See text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{The arrow turns invisible when you release the string, and only reappears when it sprouts from your opponent's chest.}

Your next ranged weapon attack (if it is made before the end of the spell's duration) passes through the ethereal plane on its way to its target.
This causes it to ignore all forms of obstacles in its path, except for those that extend into the ethereal plane (such as force effects and abjurations).
It therefore ignores all kinds of cover (including total cover, although you must still be somehow aware of the target's location in such a case), conditions of severe wind, and even shield or armor bonuses to the target's AC (unless those bonuses result from effects that block ethereal assaults).
Concealment and miss chances and non-physical sources of AC still apply.
You can hit an ethereal or incorporeal creature with a Phase Arrow without incurring any kind of miss chance.

\subsubsection{Piggyback}
\label{Spell:Piggyback}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Bard 3, Paladin 3, Planes 3, Sor/Wiz 3

\\ \textbf{Target:} You and one creature; see text
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{``You use the residual energies of the teleportation spell to fuel your own.''}

This spell must be cast in response to another creature finishing casting a Conjuration (Teleportation) spell that transports that creature to another location. You are then instantaneously teleported along with the creature, so that your relative positioning is maintained. If the creature does not wish for you to travel with it, it may attempt a Will save to negate your spell.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You cannot bring along creatures other than yourself\footnote{Note that the Piggyback spell is a valid target for another instance of the spell. Rumor has it that Teleportation Konga is a sport commonly practiced in Wizards' celebrations.}.

If the travel would cause you to arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, the Piggyback spell fails.

\paragraph{Augment:} If you spend 6 additional spell points, this spell does not allow a Will save.
\subsubsection{Pox}
\label{Spell:Pox}
Necromancy
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One humanoid
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous and Permanent (D); see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{``Not so pretty now...''}

The subject instantaneously takes 2 points of Constitution damage.

This damage is caused be huge, painful and hideous pustules that erupt all over the subject's skin. The pox is so disfiguring that creatures need to succeed on a DC 15 Spot check to even recognize the subject as itself.
This part of the spell is permanent unless dismissed by the caster or removed with \nameref{Spell:RemoveCurse}, persisting even if the Constitution damage is healed.

Protections against magical diseases are effective against this spell.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, you can affect an additional subject within range.

\emph{Special:} This spell immediately ends if the caster dies. 

\subsection{'R' Spells}
\subsubsection{Repelling Light}
\label{Spell:RepellingLight}
Abjuration [Light]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sun 4
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 10 ft.
\\ \textbf{Area:} 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.} 

You bring into being a mobile, globe of light that prevents the entrance of many types of foul creatures.
The globe moves around with you.

The effect hedges out evil outsiders, undead creatures, natives of the plane of shadow, and creatures who take damage or penalties from bright light or sunlight. A creature of the listed types can penetrate the barrier if it succeeds on a Will save. 
Even so, crossing the barrier deals the creature 2d6 points of damage.

This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing the globe against a creature that the spell keeps at bay lets the creature in (without dealing damage), and prevents the spell from affecting it again until it exits the emanation and attempts to re-enter.

Creatures with reach sufficient to stand outside the globe and attack the caster can do so, even with natural weapons (the globe does not do its work instantaneously).

The spell's area is illuminated to the point of bright illumination. In addition, shadowy illumination extends out to twice the spell's listed radius.
If an area of magical light and an area of magical darkness overlap, the spell on which more spell points were spent prevails.
If an equal number of spell points were spent on both spells, ambient light conditions remain.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every 4 additional spell points you spend, the globe's range and radius increases by 5'.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, creatures that attempt to move into the spell's area are \emph{blown away} from the caster if they fail the will save.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Roguespace}
\label{Spell:Roguespace}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 immediate action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{You instantaneously slide into a pocket dimension, allowing you to avoid harmful effects.}

When you cast this spell in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.

You can cast this spell quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come within range of a dangerous effect.

\paragraph{Augment:} If you spend 4 additional spell points, you take only half damage even on a failed Reflex save.

\subsection{'S' Spells}
\subsubsection{Searing Blade}
\label{Spell:SearingBlade}
Evocation [Light]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Paladin 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} Weapon touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round; See text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{You imbue a weapon with the power to blast the dark and unclean.}

Your next successful attack with the weapon (if it is made before the end of the spell's duration) deals an additional 3d6 points of damage if the target of the attack is an undead creature or an ooze, half that amount otherwise.
A creature that is harmed by or takes penalties from sunlight or bright light takes double damage
(meaning that a non-undead, non-ooze creature that takes penalties from light takes normal damage).

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, the damage against undead creatures and oozes increases by 1d6 (with a corresponding increase in damage against other creatures).

\subsubsection{Seeker Arrow}
\label{Spell:SeekerArrow}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 4
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round; See text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{``There is no such thing as an impossible shot. Only somewhat trickier ones.''}

Your next ranged weapon attack (if it is made before the end of the spell's duration) can work even if you do not have line of effect or line of sight to your intended target.
As long as you visualize the correct square when firing and the projectile has some possible path along which it could travel to the target, you may make the attack normally.
Additionally, this attack is not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.
Other detrimental factors, such as range, conditions of severe wind, and the target's AC apply normally.

For example, you could try to fire an arrow around a boulder and at a target you know to be hiding behind it, if you know (or can guess) the square in which the target is.
You could, however, not try to fire an arrow at a creature trapped in a \nameref{Spell:ResilientSphere}, even if you can see it, since no path exists through a Resilient Sphere.

\subsubsection{Sepia Snake Ward}
\label{Spell:SepiaSnakeWard}
Conjuration (Creation) [Force]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Commerce 3, Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Target:} One touched pouch or lock

\emph{''I almost feel sorry for the thieves.``}

This spell functions as \nameref{Spell:SepiaSnakeSigil} (including the augmentation option), except as noted here.

When cast on a pouch, the snake strikes those who would attempt to use Sleight of Hand to sneak into the pouch or steal the pouch as a whole using the Sleight of Hand skill.

When cast on a lock, the snake strikes those who would attempt to force it open with the Open Lock skill.

Simply attempting to access the container normally does not trigger the spell.

The hidden ward cannot be detected by normal observation, and \nameref{Spell:DetectMagic} reveals only that the pouch or lock is magical.

\emph{Note:} Magic traps such as Sepia Snake Wards are hard to detect and disable. 
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the runes and Disable Device to thwart them. 
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for a Sepia Snake Ward.

\subsubsection[Swift See Invisibility]{See Invisibility, Swift}
\label{Spell:SwiftSeeInvisibility}
Divination
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 2 rounds
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{Hidden things reveal themselves to you in a flash, but the vision fades rapidly.}

This spell functions as the \nameref{Spell:SeeInvisibility} spell (excluding augmentation options), except as noted here.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.

\subsubsection{Shadow Warriors}
\label{Spell:ShadowWarriors}
Illusion (Shadow)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 round
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Effect:} 5 phantom warriors
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{Several shadows appear on the ground, which then immediately stand up, defying all logic.}

You draw forth matter from the plane of shadows to form several phantom warriors. 
You place the warriors independently within the spell's range.
They can share another's creature's space.
These soldiers appear fully armed, and are clad in glistening black full plate armors.

Once created, the warriors stay in their square, standing in an imposing manner, weapons drawn.
Each warrior threatens the spaces around it, and may take one attack of opportunity per round
(but no other attacks). They can flank with each other, as well as with other allied creatures.

The warriors do not block line of sight or line of effect, nor do they hinder the movement of
any creature. They are not creatures, and are not subject to targeted spells.

While the spell is active, you gain a circumstance bonus on intimidate checks equal to the number
of active warriors.

The relevant statistics of a shadow warrior are given on the \nameref{tab:ShadowWarriors} table.
\begin{table*}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item KAM is the caster's key ability modifier, and CL is his caster level.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, you gain an additional warrior when casting this spell.

\subsubsection{Shun}
\label{Spell:Shun}
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{''SHUN! Shun the nonbeliever!``}

The targeted creature is compelled to avoid the presence of others.
It must spend its actions physically distancing itself from every creature within line of sight.
It need not expend any resources to do so (including spell points or magic item charges) unless doing so is the only way to retreat.
A creature engaged in melee combat typically takes the withdraw action. 
A creature not aware of any other creatures within line of sight typically does its best to hide.

One round after the spell is cast, the subject receives a Will saving throw. 
If the saving throw is successful, the subject may act normally from there on,
otherwise it continues to eschew contact with others while the spell lasts.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, this spell can affect an additional target.
No target of the spell can be more than 15 feet from another target of the spell.

\subsubsection{Spell Karma}
\label{Spell:SpellKarma}
Abjuration
\\ \textbf{Level:} Dread Knight 6
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 11

\emph{``You think you scare me? Give me your best shot!''}

The spells of a spellcaster under the influence of this spell rebound back upon him, as if all creatures he targets were under a \nameref{Spell:SpellTurning} spell.

\subsubsection{Squirt}
\label{Spell:Squirt}
Conjuration (Creation) [Water]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Water 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} 60 ft.
\\ \textbf{Area:} 60-ft. line
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude half
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{A geyser of cold water springs out from your outstretched hand.}

All creatures caught in the area of the spell take 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.
A successful fortitude save halves the damage.
Objects (and some creatures) are immune to nonlethal damage.

Most of the water you create dissipates as soon as the line reaches its end point, leaving only a thin layer of wetness on the surface beneath.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\subsubsection{Starfall}
\label{Spell:Starfall}
Evocation [Light]
\\ \textbf{Level:} Moon 9
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
\\ \textbf{Effect:} A shower of Moon Bolts
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 6 rounds
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} See text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 17

\emph{You bring down half the sky on top of your enemies, with devastating results.}

Immediately upon the completion of the spell, and at the start of your turn each round of the spell's duration thereafter, all creatures within the spell's range except for those you specifically exclude are subjected to a \nameref{Spell:MoonBolt}, cast as if augmented to cast a number of spell points equal to the number of spell points you spent on the Starfall spell. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to the creatures struck by the bolts, the Starfall seeks them out on its own.

\subsubsection{Step through Earth}
\label{Spell:StepThroughEarth}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Earth 4, Ranger 4
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 7

\emph{You fall forwards on to the ground, but instead of hitting it, you fall through it and appear somewhere else.}

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to another spot within range.
You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction.
However, both the destination square and the square from which you transfer yourself must contain earth or unworked stone, and a straight ''passage`` of such terrain must exist between the two squares. You could not, for example, transport yourself into or out of a box containing dirt, or a castle courtyard whose foundations and underlying dungeons block have replaced the natural soil.

After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. 
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. 

If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, the spell fails.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend an additional 6 spell points, you can cast this spell as a move action.
 \item If you spend an additional 6 spell points, you can act after casting this spell (provided you have actions to do so).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Stunning Arrow}
\label{Spell:StunningArrow}
Evocation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Ranger 2
\\ \textbf{Components:} V
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 swift action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} One arrow or bolt touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Until end of round; see text
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Fort negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No, Yes; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{You imbue a single arrow with a magical charge powerful enough to overwhelm the senses of its victims.}

A creature struck by the projectile must succeed on a fortitude save or be \emph{stunned} for one round.
Spell resistance applies against the stunning effect.
The projectile remains so enhanced only until the end of the current round. 
If the projectile does not hit a creature before the end of the round, the spell drains away harmlessly.

\subsubsection{Summon Weapon}
\label{Spell:SummonWeapon}
Conjuration (Teleportation)
\\ \textbf{Level:} Blackguard 1, Paladin 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Touch
\\ \textbf{Target:} One masterwork weapon with which you are proficient
\\ \textbf{Duration:} Permanent until discharged
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{You call your weapon directly to your hand.}

First, you must cast this spell on a weapon. This weapon can be a magic weapon.
The weapon cannot be attended by another creature at the time the spell is cast.

Thereafter, you can summon the weapon by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) as an immediate action. 
The weapon appears instantly in your hand, and the spell ends.

If the weapon is being attended by another creature at the time you speak the special word, the spell does not work, 
but you know who the possessor is and where that creature is located when the summoning is attempted.
This does not discharge the spell.

The weapon cannot be summoned across planar boundaries.
Attempting to do so does not discharge the spell.

\subsubsection{Suppress Magic}
\label{Spell:SuppressMagic}
Abjuration
\\ \textbf{Level:} Magic 3, Sor/Wiz 3
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:} 1 round

\\ \textbf{Target:} Willing spellcaster touched
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 10 min./level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{''Magic is strictly forbidden in the presence of the king.``}

The targeted spellcaster becomes incapable of casting spells. Spell-like and supernatural abilities are not affected.

Should the spellcaster later become unwilling, he may attempt a Will saving throw with a -4 penalty to shake off the effects of the spell, once.

The spellcaster is surrounded by a visible aura while the spell is in effect, making it obvious (to those with sufficient \nameref{sec:Spellcraft}) when it has been thrown off, or expired.

\paragraph{Augment:} If you spend 4 additional spell points, this spell's duration changes to 24 hours.

\subsubsection{Surge of Strength}
\label{Spell:SurgeOfStrength}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Blackguard 1, Paladin 1, Strength 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S

\emph{Your muscles momentarily ripple with divine strength.}

You gain a +2 sacred bonus to strength, and two temporary hit points.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, the sacred bonus and number of temporary hit points increase by 1.

\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level (D)
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None, Will negates; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} No, Yes; see text
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 3

\emph{Your weapons appear to swirl around and leave trailing lines, creating a dizzying display of skill.}

An opponent struck by both of the weapons affected by this spell in the same round by the same creature must succeed on a Will save or be \emph{stunned} for one round.
Spell resistance applies against the stunning effect, as does immunity or resistance to mind-affecting spells, illusions, or patterns.

\subsection{'U' Spells}
\subsubsection{Uncanny Accuracy}

\emph{Your opponent's weak points suddenly seem more accessible.}

Whenever you make a weapon attack against a flanked opponent or against an opponent denied his dexterity bonus, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage and gain a +2  bonus on the attack roll.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every 3 additional spell points you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level

\emph{The actual appearance of the weapons you wield does not change, but somehow they seem more cruel and dangerous.}

For the duration of this spell, all melee weapons you use gain the benefit of the Wounding weapon enhancement.

\subsubsection{Warrior's Impetus}

\\ \textbf{Target:} One creature
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level
\\ \textbf{Saving Throw:} None
\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{You imbue your allies with a portion of the speed and power of all warriors who have ever followed your cause.}

When making a full attack action, a targeted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. 
The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. 
(This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a \nameref{Spell:Haste}, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

The targets also gain a +3 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. (This bonus on attack rolls stacks with the untyped bonus provided by \nameref{Spell:Haste}.)
\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell can affect an additional creature.

\subsubsection{Winged Weapon}
\label{Spell:WingedWeapon}
Transmutation
\\ \textbf{Level:} Spellbreaker 1
\\ \textbf{Components:} V

\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless, object)
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 1

\emph{The weapon grows golden, faintly translucent wings that flutter rapidly.}

The touched weapon gains the benefits of the Throwing and Returning enhancements for the duration of the spell.

\paragraph{Augment:} This spell can be augmented in one or both of the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you spend 6 additional spell points, the weapon gains the benefit of the Dancing enhancement rather than the Throwing and Returning enhancements, and the base duration of the spell is increased to 4 rounds.
 \item For every 2 additional spell points you spend, this spell's duration is increased by one round.
\end{enumerate}

\\ \textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 5

\emph{The horde of lycanthropes emits a howl of pain.}

Every lycanthrope caught in the area takes 50 points of damage and is \emph{paralyzed} for one round. A successful will save halves the damage and negates the paralysis.

\subsubsection{Woodbolt}

\emph{You create a spearlike branch that hurls itself at your enemies.}

You create a wooden bolt shoots forth from your outstretched arm and strikes a target within range, dealing 1d6 points of damage.
You must succeed on a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) with the bolt for it to deal damage.

\paragraph{Augment:} For every additional spell point you spend, this spell's damage increases by one die (d6).

\subsection{'X' Spells}
\subsubsection{X-ray Vision}
\label{Spell:XRayVision}

\\ \textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 5
\\ \textbf{Components:} V, S
\\ \textbf{Casting Time:}  1 standard action
\\ \textbf{Range:} Personal
\\ \textbf{Target:} You
\\ \textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level
\\ \textbf{Spell Points:} 9

\emph{''The toughest part is to remember to open your door.``}

You gain the ability to see into and through solid matter.

The range of the X-ray vision is 20'. Within this range, you see as if in normal light even if there is no illumination (magical darkness is ignored as well). X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. A thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.
X-ray vision is black and white only but otherwise functions like normal sight.

Note that although X-ray vision may pierce certain forms of concealment, it does not grant line of effect.

In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks made to re-set broken bones.

\paragraph{Augment:} You can augment this spell in one or both of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every 2 additional spell points you spend, the radius of your X-ray vision increases by 5 feet.
 \item If you spend 4 additional spell points, stone, metal, wood and dirt do not block the X-ray vision. 
\end{enumerate}
